Here are some basic concepts:\n  a command is a process that you ask the bot to do. They are differenciated by their name and to call (=invoke) them you must append `::` before the name of the command.\n  arguments, also known as parameters are options you can pass to the commands. You specify them by writting them down after the said command.\n\nThere are many kinds of parameters.\n`<arg>` is a **required** parameter that must be specified. If you don't you'll get a `NotEnoughArguments` error.\n`[arg]` are **optional** arguments\n`...` means that you can specify multiple arguments of this type. All arguments are separated by a space (` `)."
